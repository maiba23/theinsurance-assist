    question:
      "Do I still need a life insurance policy if I am covered by my employer?",
    answer: `Typically, when a life policy is issued at work, it may not provide you with optimal coverage. Often, the policy will expire If you leave, so you may find yourself exposed in between jobs. At that point, it could be more expensive to issue a new policy. Group policies are not always tailored to your specific needs and to your dependents. This is where we come in, to offer you something that takes care of your financial needs and goals.`,
